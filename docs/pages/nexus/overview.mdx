# What is Nexus?
Nexus represents the next generation of smart account technology, built on the foundation of ERC-7579. It's a significant evolution from our previous [Biconomy Smart Account v2](https://docs.biconomy.io/account), offering:

```tsx twoslash
import { createNexusClient } from "nexus/packages/sdk";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { baseSepolia } from "viem/chains";
import { http } from "viem";

const privateKey = "0x...";
const account = privateKeyToAccount(`0x${privateKey}`)
const nexusClient = await createNexusClient({
    owner: account,
    chain: baseSepolia,
    transport: http()
});

const address = await nexusClient.account.getAddress();
```

- Enhanced gas optimization
