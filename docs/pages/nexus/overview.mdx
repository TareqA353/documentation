# What is Nexus?
Nexus is the next generation smart account solution, built on the ERC-7579 standard, representing a significant upgrade from [Biconomy Smart Account v2](/quickstart-react). It offers enhanced modularity, security, and scalability to meet the evolving needs of developers.

### Key Features
- **Modular:** Nexus implements the 7579 modular interface, which works with a growing list of open sourced modules to tap into permissionless innovation. You can choose from a wide range of third party modules to easily plug-in new capabilities.
- **Gas Efficiency:** Optimized transactions for lower costs.
- **Security:** Nexus has been rigorously audited and tested, ensuring that dapps integrating it can trust its smart account implementation. [Audits](/nexus/contractsAndAudits) by leading firms Spearbit and Cyfrin provide top-tier security assurances.
- **ERC-7579 Compliant:** Built on the latest standards for smart account interoperability.
- **Improved session key flow:** Improved session key flow through Permissions and Policies

Nexus is designed to scale with the growing needs of developer use cases, providing them with high flexibility and future-proofing their accounts with new modules development.
