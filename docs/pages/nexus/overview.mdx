import { http, parseEther } from "viem"; 

const privateKey = "PRIVATE_KEY";
const account = privateKeyToAccount(`0x${privateKey}`)
const bundlerUrl = "https://sdk-relayer.staging.biconomy.io/api/v3/84532/nJPK7B3ru.dd7f7861-190d-41bd-af80-6877f74b8f44"; 

const nexusClient = await createNexusClient({ 
    signer: account,
