# What is Nexus?
Nexus is the next generation of smart account technology, built on the ERC-7579 standard. It’s a major upgrade from the [Biconomy Smart Account v2](https://docs.biconomy.io/account), delivering enhanced modularity, security, and scalability.

### Key Features
- **Modular:** Nexus implements the 7579 modular interface, which works with a growing list of open sourced modules to tap into permissionless innovation. You can choose from a wide range of third party modules to easily plug-in new capabilities.
- **Gas Efficiency:** Optimized transactions for lower costs.
- **Security:** Nexus is highly audited and extensively tested to ensure every dapp that integrates it doesn’t need to worry about attacks via their smart account implementation. Thanks to rigorous audits by Spearbit & Cyfrin, two of the best in the business, devs can rest assured about security.
- **ERC-7579 Compliant:** Built on the latest standards for smart account interoperability.
- **Improved session key flow:** Improved session key flow through Permissions and Policies

Nexus is designed to scale with the growing needs of developer use cases, providing them with high flexibility and future-proofing their accounts with new modules development.

# Nexus SDK
The Nexus SDK simplifies interaction with the ERC-7579 Nexus Smart Account, offering a complete toolkit to integrate Modular Smart Accounts effortlessly.

```ts twoslash
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { createNexusClient } from "@biconomy/sdk";
import { baseSepolia } from "viem/chains"; 
import { http, parseEther } from "viem"; 

const privateKey = "PRIVATE_KEY";
const account = privateKeyToAccount(`0x${privateKey}`)
const bundlerUrl = "https://sdk-relayer.staging.biconomy.io/api/v3/84532/nJPK7B3ru.dd7f7861-190d-41bd-af80-6877f74b8f44"; 

const nexusClient = await createNexusClient({ 
    signer: account, 
    chain: baseSepolia,

});

const smartAccountAddress = await nexusClient.account.address; 
```
