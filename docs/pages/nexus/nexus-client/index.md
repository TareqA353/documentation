# Nexus client

The Nexus Client is an interface for interacting with Nexus smart accounts. It allows seamless management of smart accounts, enabling account creation, execution of transactions, and management of account modules (validation and execution). 

## Usage

```typescript twoslash
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { createNexusClient } from "@biconomy/sdk-canary";
import { baseSepolia } from "viem/chains"; 
import { http } from "viem"; 

const privateKey = "PRIVATE_KEY";
const account = privateKeyToAccount(`0x${privateKey}`)
const bundlerUrl = "https://sdk-relayer.staging.biconomy.io/api/v3/84532/nJPK7B3ru.dd7f7861-190d-41bd-af80-6877f74b8f44"; 

const nexusClient = await createNexusClient({
  holder: account, 
  chain: baseSepolia,
  transport: http(), 
  bundlerTransport: http(bundlerUrl), 
})
```
