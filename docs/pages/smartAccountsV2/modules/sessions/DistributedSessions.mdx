# Distributed Sessions

## Introduction

Biconomy’s Distributed Sessions are a powerful feature designed to enhance the efficiency, security, and user experience of decentralized applications. Leveraging Biconomy’s Delegated Authorisation Network (DAN), our distributed sessions solution provide a seamless way to manage authorization keys on MPC network and automate transactions securely, within given permissions context and efficiently. This product offers developers a zero-development, zero-custody sessions solution that can be easily integrated directly from the frontend.

## What is DAN?

The Delegated Authorisation Network (DAN) is Biconomy’s blockchain-agnostic programmable signing infrastructure, which leverages the economic security of Eigenlayer AVS. It is designed to enhance the security, customizability, and speed of managing authorization keys for smart accounts.

## Benefits of Distributed Sessions with DAN

**Enhanced Security:** Distributed sessions minimise the exposure of the private key by storing shards in the nodes and generating signature if certain conditions are met. In context of a session, they are ephemeral and even if a session key is compromised, the attacker gains limited access, protecting the user's main account and funds.

**Interoperable:** By storing private keys on the DAN network, even if the browser crashes or browser storage is compromised, users can still access their sessions.

**Automation and Efficiency:** Users can leave an intent, go to sleep and automated transactions will still be processed in a secure way.

## How Can I use it?

Currently when you create a session our [ABI session validation module](/smartAccountsV2/modules/sessions/abiSessionValidationModule) is used, and permissions are stored on-chain. However, the private key associated with these permissions can be stored in DAN by setting the `storeSessionKeyInDAN` to `true` while calling the [`createSession()`](/smartAccountsV2/tutorials/sessions/createSession) helper.
If you want to generate a session key with dan, or sign a message using the session key then the following utility helpers can be used:

- [generateSessionKey()](/smartAccountsV2/tutorials/utils/DAN/generateSessionKey)
- [signMessage()](/smartAccountsV2/tutorials/utils/DAN/signMessage)

### Coming Soon...

We will soon also facilitate the permissions object being passed to DAN (off chain) which will omit the need to use our ABI SVM and associated gas costs.
